# Modal Closing Issue - FIXED ✅

## Issue: Reown modal closes immediately when wallet is selected instead of opening wallet

### ✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

**Root Cause:** The code was automatically closing the modal after wallet selection, preventing the deep link from triggering.

### 🔧 FIXES APPLIED:

**1. Removed Premature Modal Closing:**
```javascript
// REMOVED: Automatic modal closing that was interfering
// Old code was force-closing modal after 1 second
// Now: Let Reown handle wallet selection naturally
```

**2. Enhanced Mobile Wallet Flow:**
- Modal stays open until wallet connection completes
- Reown handles deep linking automatically
- No interference with wallet selection process

**3. Improved Connection Monitoring:**
- Extended timeouts: iOS (90s), Android (100s)
- Better interval timing: 2 seconds between checks
- More attempts: 20 for mobile vs 5 for desktop
- Clearer progress messages

**4. Smart Mobile Bridge:**
- Detects when user leaves for wallet app
- Monitors return from wallet app
- Non-intrusive connection verification
- Auto-cleanup after 90 seconds

### 📱 NEW MOBILE BEHAVIOR:

**✅ Correct Flow:**
1. User taps "Fix Connection" → Modal opens
2. User selects wallet → Modal triggers deep link
3. Wallet app opens → User approves connection
4. Returns to browser → Connection completes automatically
5. Modal closes naturally → Draining process starts

**❌ Old Broken Flow:**
1. User taps "Fix Connection" → Modal opens
2. User selects wallet → Modal closes immediately ❌
3. Deep link never triggers → Wallet doesn't open
4. User stuck in loading state

### 🚀 ENHANCED FEATURES:

**Better Mobile Detection:**
- Tracks when user leaves page for wallet app
- Detects return with improved timing
- Longer delays for wallet connection establishment

**Improved Error Messages:**
- "Please select a wallet from the modal and complete the connection"
- Platform-specific timeout messages
- Clear guidance for mobile users

**Extended Timeouts:**
- iOS: 90 seconds (was 60s)
- Android: 100 seconds (was 75s)
- Desktop: 30 seconds (unchanged)
- More generous timing for mobile app switching

### 📊 CONNECTION MONITORING:

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Check every 2 seconds (was 1 second)
- 20 total attempts (was 15)
- Progress updates every 3 attempts
- Final check with 3-second delay

**Desktop Performance:**
- Check every 200ms (unchanged)
- 5 total attempts (unchanged)
- 30-second timeout (unchanged)

### 🎯 EXPECTED MOBILE BEHAVIOR NOW:

1. **Modal Opens:** All 350+ wallets displayed
2. **Wallet Selection:** Tap any wallet (MetaMask, Trust, etc.)
3. **Deep Link Triggers:** Modal stays open, wallet app launches
4. **Connection Flows:** Approve in wallet app
5. **Return Detected:** Bridge detects return to browser
6. **Success:** Connection completes, modal closes, draining starts
